# Clustering Analysis on Seeds Dataset

This project explores various clustering techniques applied to the **Seeds dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of geometrical properties of kernels from three different varieties of wheat. The project evaluates the performance of different clustering algorithms, including **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **KMeans Shift**, along with various preprocessing methods like **normalization**, **transformation**, and **PCA**.

## üìä Dataset

- **Name**: Seeds Dataset  
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds)  
- The dataset contains 7 attributes related to the geometric properties of wheat kernels, and the goal is to classify them into three types of wheat.

## üß™ Clustering Techniques

The following clustering algorithms were applied:

1. **K-Means Clustering**  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**  
3. **KMeans Shift Clustering**  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Approaches

Each algorithm was tested under four preprocessing scenarios:

1. **No Preprocessing**  
2. **Normalization Only**  
3. **Transformation + Normalization (T+N)**  
4. **Transformation + Normalization + PCA (T+N+PCA)**

## üèÜ Results

| Criterion                | Best Result                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Best Clustering Algorithm** | K-Means (with T+N+PCA)               |
| **Best Number of Clusters**   | 3 (as expected for seed types)       |
| **Best Silhouette Score**    | ~0.32 (K-Means with T+N+PCA)         |

- **K-Means** performed consistently well across all preprocessing combinations.
- The best performance was achieved with **Transformation + Normalization + PCA (T+N+PCA)**, leading to the highest silhouette score.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** showed improvement with normalization but did not outperform **K-Means**.
- **KMeans Shift** had higher computational costs but performed decently without preprocessing.

## üìà Visualizations

Clustering results were visualized using **2D projections post-PCA** to illustrate the separation between clusters across different techniques and preprocessing steps. 

## üß† Conclusion

- **K-Means clustering** proved to be the most reliable and effective algorithm, especially when combined with full preprocessing (T+N+PCA).
- **Hierarchical Clustering** improved with normalization but did not match K-Means' performance.
- **KMeans Shift** showed promise but was computationally more expensive.
- The optimal number of clusters was found to be **3**, corresponding to the three varieties of wheat in the dataset.
- **Silhouette analysis** confirmed that **K-Means with T+N+PCA** resulted in the highest clustering quality.
