# Clustering Assignment: Comparative Performance Study of Different Clustering Algorithms

This project explores the performance of different clustering algorithms using various pre-processing techniques and evaluating them with different cluster sizes on a small dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis was performed using a Colab notebook, and results are shared in terms of tables, graphs, and conclusions.

---

## **1. Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to:
- Compare multiple clustering algorithms.
- Apply different pre-processing techniques (e.g., scaling, normalization).
- Analyze performance across various numbers of clusters.
- Evaluate results using multiple metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index).

## **2. Dataset**
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Dataset Used:** [Dataset Name]  
  *(Provide a brief description of the dataset here, including the number of features and samples.)*

---

## **3. Pre-Processing Techniques**
The following pre-processing techniques were applied to the dataset:
- Standardization (Z-score normalization)
- Min-Max Scaling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## **4. Clustering Algorithms Used**
The following clustering algorithms were implemented:
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. Birch Clsutering

## **5. Evaluation Metrics**
The performance of each clustering algorithm was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Silhouette Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to others.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index:** Measures the average similarity ratio of clusters.
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index:** Evaluates cluster separation.
- **Cluster Distribution Plots:** Visual representation of clusters in the feature space.

---

## **6. Results and Discussion**
- **Tables:** Comparative performance of algorithms on different evaluation metrics.
- **Graphs:** Visual representation of cluster boundaries and evaluation metric trends.
- **Conclusions:** 
  - Discuss the best-performing algorithm for the dataset.
  - Impact of different numbers of clusters and pre-processing techniques.
  - Limitations and potential improvements.
